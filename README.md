Hi. If you are reading this, you are brave, brave person. I have collected my answers to <i>Scala for the Impatient</i>
since I could not find a complete set of answers anywhere.

My environment is of Scala 2.9.1, which some of the examples questions in the text do not seem to match. The text does
not indicate the version it was written against, and so I have no idea and have not yet been able to infer. Answers that
seem out of alignment in the text have been commented on as such. I also google a lot in answering, since the questions
often say to "search the scala doc", which is extremely difficult for a newbie. Suffice it to say, some answers may
include tricks not yet introduced explicitly in the text.

This is my first earnest effort to learn Scala (as a derivative interest to the
<a href="https://github.com/playframework/play">Play</a> (2.0) framework), and so far that I've seen. There are often
many atomically-concise styles of answering problems with equivalent outcomes, but perhaps non-equivalent nuances.

Thoughts without validation inherit the dangers of an unsound mind. So I hope this helps someone out there realize, that
in learning Scala, they are no more crazy than the rest of us who write Scala. And that to myself as well.
